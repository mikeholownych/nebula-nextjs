# Step 1 — Presence detector + seed the ledger

**Read ONLY this file.** Do not read any other reference file until this one tells you to.

This step decides whether the rest of the audit has anything to look at, seeds the audit ledger, and records signals later steps need. Run it **before** any other work.

## Tools

Load via `ToolSearch select:Grep,mcp__wizard-tools__audit_seed_checks,mcp__wizard-tools__audit_resolve_checks` once at the start of this step. Subsequent steps reuse `audit_resolve_checks` to patch each check as it resolves, so it stays loaded.

## Status

Emit, in order:

```
[STATUS] Detecting PostHog and attribution surfaces
[STATUS] Seeding audit checklist
```

## Action

### a. Detect presence

Run **two `Grep` calls in parallel**, both with `output_mode: "files_with_matches"`:

1. PostHog init surface — any of:
   `posthog\.init\(|new PostHog\(|posthog\.Posthog\(|Posthog\(`
2. Attribution / acquisition signals — any of:
   `utm_source|utm_medium|utm_campaign|gclid|fbclid|msclkid|msfclkid|li_fat_id|ttclid|twclid|partner_id|referrer_id`

### b. Abort or continue

- **Init grep returns zero hits anywhere in the project:** emit `[ABORT] PostHog SDK initialization not found` and stop. The wizard catches `[ABORT]` and terminates the run. Do NOT seed the ledger in this case.
- **Init found:** continue to (c). Even projects with no explicit click-id capture rely on PostHog's built-in UTM auto-capture; each step's individual rules decide whether to skip or warn based on the kind of evidence present.

### c. Seed the audit ledger

The ledger lives at `.posthog-audit-checks.json` and renders live in the wizard sidebar / "Audit plan" tab. **The runtime does not pre-seed this skill's ledger** — call `mcp__wizard-tools__audit_seed_checks` directly here with the exact payload below. The tool replaces the file atomically, so calling it once at the start of every run is safe.

```json
{
  "checks": [
    { "id": "attribution-utm-survives-landing",   "area": "Attribution", "label": "UTM params survive landing-page routing",                "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "attribution-survives-auth-redirect", "area": "Attribution", "label": "UTM params survive auth/OAuth redirects",                  "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "attribution-first-touch-set-once",   "area": "Attribution", "label": "First-touch attribution properties use $set_once",        "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "attribution-custom-click-ids",       "area": "Attribution", "label": "Ad-platform click ids captured (gclid, fbclid, msclkid)", "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "attribution-on-conversion-events",   "area": "Attribution", "label": "Conversion events carry attribution context",             "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "attribution-cross-subdomain-cookie",  "area": "Attribution — Configuration", "label": "cross_subdomain_cookie configured for multi-subdomain projects", "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "attribution-cookieless-mode-impact",  "area": "Attribution — Configuration", "label": "cookieless_mode tradeoff acknowledged",                          "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "attribution-consent-integration",     "area": "Attribution — Configuration", "label": "Consent banner wired to PostHog opt_in/opt_out",                 "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "write-report",                        "area": "Write report",                "label": "Render posthog-audit-attribution-report.md",                     "status": "pending" }
  ]
}
```

## Record acquisition signal for later steps

Keep the acquisition-signal grep result in working memory. Step 2's `attribution-custom-click-ids` check uses it to decide whether to warn on absence (project clearly runs paid acquisition but doesn't capture click ids) vs. skip (no paid-acquisition signal anywhere — silence is fine). Step 3's `attribution-cookieless-mode-impact` reuses the same signal.

Do not read any project files in this step. Do not call `audit_resolve_checks`. Do not preload future steps.
